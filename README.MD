## 📝 Overview

**StackIt** is a minimalistic, frontend-only question-and-answer platform designed for structured knowledge sharing. It simulates the core functionality of platforms like Stack Overflow, allowing users to ask questions, post answers, vote, and stay updated — all within a clean, distraction-free interface.

Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS**, the project also experiments with **Gemini AI** to assist users with smart suggestions and contextual features.
